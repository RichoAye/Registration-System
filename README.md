# Student Registration Form

## Project Description

This project is a **Student Registration Form** designed for educational institutions, enabling students to easily submit their registration details for courses. The form collects basic personal information, such as the student's full name, email address, date of birth, gender, the course they are enrolling in, and their year of study.

The form features user-friendly UI/UX design with clear input fields and a visually appealing layout, making it easy for students to register.
